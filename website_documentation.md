## Content Management

The website is designed to work with a headless CMS for content management. While the current implementation uses static data, it can be easily connected to a CMS like Contentful or Sanity.

### Adding New Content

To add new content to the website:

2. **Solutions**: Add new entries to the `solutionCategories` array in `solutions.js`

4. **Use Cases**: Add new entries to the `useCases` array in `use-cases.js`

### Images and Assets

All static assets should be placed in the `public` directory:
- Images: `public/images/`
- Icons: `public/icons/`
- Fonts: `public/fonts/`

## Maintenance and Updates

### Dependency Updates

To update dependencies:

```bash
npm update
```

For major version updates, check the release notes of each package for breaking changes.

### Next.js Updates

When updating Next.js to a new major version, refer to the official migration guide.

### Performance Monitoring

Use Vercel Analytics to monitor website performance and user behavior.

## SEO Considerations

The website includes several SEO optimizations:

1. **Metadata**: Each page includes appropriate title and meta description tags
2. **Structured Data**: Add JSON-LD structured data for rich search results
3. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for optimized images
4. **Performance**: Optimized for Core Web Vitals
5. **Sitemap**: Generate a sitemap.xml file for search engines
6. **Robots.txt**: Configure robots.txt for proper crawling

### Adding Structured Data

Example of adding structured data to a page:

```javascript
<Head>
  <title>NextWave | Intelligent Automation for Tomorrow's Challenges</title>
  <meta name="description" content="NextWave delivers cutting-edge AI solutions and IoT products for Australian businesses" />
  <script
    type="application/ld+json"
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      __html: JSON.stringify({
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "NextWave",
        "url": "https://nextwave.au",
        "logo": "https://nextwave.au/images/logo.png",
        "description": "NextWave delivers cutting-edge AI solutions and IoT products for Australian businesses"
      })
    }}
  />
</Head>
```
